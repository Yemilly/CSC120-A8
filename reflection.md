- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a bird named birdie and their candy.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
what helped me start this hw, was to keep it simple as possible, implement all the methods and creat a "sout" for all of them.
